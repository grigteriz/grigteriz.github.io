            <p>Hello! Welcome to the LepreCoin Privacy Policy, which describes how redBit as a data handler collects, uses,
                    processes, and shares information about the user in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation
                    (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of April 27, 2016).</p>
                <p>This policy applies to all of the games available on our website www.leprecoin.xyz, on mobile devices, PC, or
                    other platforms such as Facebook. It also applies to our Marketing and Advertising activities on all platforms
                    and other services that we may provide to you from time to time. In this Privacy Policy we refer to our games,
                    websites, marketing and advertising activities and other services collectively as our &#8220;Services&#8221;.
                </p>
                <p>By downloading, accessing and/or playing our games, or interacting with our websites or other Services, you agree
                    to the use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns about providing
                    information to us or it being used as described in this Privacy Policy you should not use our games or other
                    Services.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on 20.08.2019.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>Information about the user is collected when he or she plays our games or uses our other Services. Most of this
                    data comes directly from the user, such as device information, country and region, and game play information. We
                    use this data to provide our games and Services to you, including for the purposes of optimization, preventing
                    fraud, customizing in-game offers and verifying purchases. We may also use it for the other purposes set out in
                    this Privacy Policy, including for Marketing and Advertising purposes.</p>
                <p>Most of the information that we collect about the user comes directly from him or her when he or she plays our
                    games, interacts with our websites, advertising or other Services. Broadly the information we collect about the
                    user relates to the type of device he or she is using, how he or she plays our games (such as levels attempted
                    and purchases made) and may include information that he or she submits when creating an account with us or which
                    he or she allows us to access when he or she connects to his or her social network accounts through our games or
                    Services. We may also collect information from advertising platforms and partners and other third parties such
                    as information about purchases and interests.</p>
                <p>In more detail, depending on which of our Services you (as the user) interact with, we may collect and process
                    the following types of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>details on the use and interaction of our games, advertising and other Services (for example, information
                        about how and when you play our games or visit our website(s), what device you use to access our game and on
                        the use of our games on social networks;</li>
                    <li>information that provided by the user when he or she fills in forms, answers questions or completes surveys
                        when using any of our Services, when the user creates an account with us or if he or she invites his or her
                        friends to use our games and Services;</li>
                    <li>the content of messages sent via our messaging systems (e.g. Mail channels, instant messaging);</li>
                    <li>the user interactions on our social media channels;</li>
                    <li>information we collect via cookies and other similar technologies;</li>
                    <li>information as further set out in this Privacy Policy, including LepreCoin profile and playing socially,
                        Marketing, and Advertising;</li>
                    <li>information we collect about you from our other group companies or other third party companies who have
                        obtained your consent or have another legal right to share such information with us (including publishing
                        partners, platforms, advertising platforms and partners and data aggregators who have obtained). This may
                        include attributes about you and your interests, as well as other games and services you use, demographic
                        and general location information. We will use this information as described in this Privacy Policy and

                <p>If the user chooses not to create a LepreCoin profile by connecting your social media account, the information
                    that we collect when you play our games will be anonymous, but we will collect device level identifiers and
                    other information associated with those identifiers including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the type of device(s) you are using to play our games or access our Services, identifiers such as IP
                        address, device identifiers, ad identifiers, a LepreCoin specific player ID, and the country or region
                        that you are playing in;</li>
                    <li>how you play our games and interact with our websites or other Services (such as which of our games you are
                        playing, your progress through the games, session time and duration, number of attempts at each level and
                        purchases made).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In some instances, when you make purchases on or through our website(s), we may collect certain payment
                    information from you on behalf of our payment service providers, but this information is temporarily cached in a
                    way that is unreadable by LepreCoin. We do not collect or retain credit card information. Our payment service
                    providers will provide us with information about your purchases so that we know if a purchase has been
                    successful.</p>
                <p>When you purchase items via our mobile apps (such as those you can purchase in the App Store, on Facebook or on
                    Google Play) we do not collect or store any payment information from you.</p>
                <p>Occasionally we may ask you for your consent to collect other information from you or your device. In this or a
                    similar circumstance, we will tell you what information we would like to collect, why we need it, and what we’ll
                    use it for.</p>
                <p>We, our suppliers and group companies, may use this information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to enable us to provide our games and other Services to you, to ensure that any purchases you make are
                        verified on our servers and activated in the games, and to provide the user with support if he or she needs
                        it;</li>
                    <li>to enable us to optimize our games for you and for the device that you are using, as well as to deliver
                        customized in game events, offers and promotions;</li>
                    <li>For the other purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy, including for Marketing and Advertising purposes;
                        and</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may also share your information with third party publishers who develop and provide games and other Services
                    to you on our behalf.</p>
                <p>We also analyze and use the information that we collect on an anonymized or aggregated basis for new product
                    development, to analyze the performance of our games, to troubleshoot and to improve and optimize the games to
                    ensure the best player experience for our players as a whole.</p>

                <p>You can choose to add information to your LepreCoin profile or to connect our Services to your account with a

                <p><strong>3.1 LepreCoin Profile</strong></p>
                <p>When you play our games, we will give you a randomly generated unique identifier which we will associate with a
                    LepreCoin account known as a &#8220;LepreCoin profile&#8221;. Your LepreCoin profile will not be
                    personally identifiable unless you choose to add your personal information to it by linking the profile to a
                    third-party account.</p>
                <p><strong>3.2 Connecting with a third party network</strong></p>
                <p>Where we make this available, you can choose to log in to your LepreCoin Profile using your account details
                    with a third party network, such as Facebook or Google. If you do this, you will be able to use your game to log
                    in on multiple devices and synchronize progress across those devices. Where available, you will also be able to
                    see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able
                    to see you and your progress), or access other features we make available in our games and other Services, such

                    Facebook account information. If you choose to play our games online on the desktop version of Facebook.com,
                    your basic Facebook account information will automatically be associated with your LepreCoin profile. Exactly
                    what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Facebook account, but typically we will receive
                    your basic public profile information such as your username, email address, age range, gender, chosen language,
                    country and any other public information.</p>
                <p>We may also collect the email account associated with your Facebook account and the name and avatar of those of
                    your Facebook friends that are already playing our games. You can opt out of this at the time at which you
                    associate your Facebook account with your LepreCoin Profile and also later in your Facebook privacy settings.
                </p>
                <p>Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your permission and we will not
                    receive any information about your Facebook friends who do not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook
                    friends to be able to see you and your progression in our games, you can prevent this in your Facebook settings.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.4 Information we receive from Google</strong></p>

                    account information. Exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Google account,
                    but typically we will receive your basic public profile information such as your name, email address and profile
                    picture. If you choose to grant us access to your Contact List, we will use and store this to help you find

                <p>We use information about you to try to make sure you only see marketing from us that might be of interest to you.
                    This includes using information that we may have about you, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ad identifiers and other non-personal information collected from your device. For more information, see Ad

                <p><strong>4.2 Marketing partners</strong></p>
                <p>When we market our games in media published by other companies, we use various third party marketing partners to
                    assist us on our behalf.</p>
                <p>Our marketing partners help us to serve ads to you by using data which they have collected about you. They
                    collect this information when you use their services or the websites and services of third parties. Our partners
                    use this information to make assumptions about the kinds of advertising you would prefer to see. If they
                    determine that you would be interested to see an advert for LepreCoin’ games or Services, they will serve you
                    with a LepreCoin ad.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our marketing partners. Although we
                    are not responsible for the data collection or data use of our marketing partners, we require our marketing
                    partners to have a legal basis for their use of your data for marketing purposes and to provide you with details
                    on how you may opt-out from data collection by them.</p>
                <p>You can disable interest-based advertising by LepreCoin or any other company by following the steps at How to
                    adjust your preferences for interest based advertising.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>Our games may include advertising for third party products and services. Unless you opt out of interest-based
                    advertising, we and our advertising partners will use information about you to improve advertising, targeting
                    and measurement systems so that we can show you relevant third party ads in our games.</p>
                <p>We use information that we hold about you to better target ads for third party goods and services to people that
                    might be most interested in them. These ads may be shown to you within our games or Services.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>5.1 What information is used for advertising?</strong></p>
                <p>We use ad identifiers and other information that we collect about you as described in this Privacy Policy to try
                    to make sure you only see ads in our games that might be of interest to you. This includes information such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ad identifiers and other information collected from your device. For more information, see ad identifiers
                        and similar technologies; the games you play and information about how you interact with our games and
                        Services;</li>
                    <li>your age, country and region, and gender; and</li>
                    <li>other demographic and interests based information that we might acquire from third parties who have obtained
                        your consent or have another legal right to share that information with us.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>5.2 Advertising partners</strong></p>
                <p>When you play our games or use our Services, non-personal identifiers and other information from your device is
                    collected and shared with advertising partners to enable the technical delivery of ads to your device.</p>
                <p>Our advertising partners may combine this information with information which they have collected about you when
                    you use their services (or the websites or services of third parties) in order to serve you more relevant ads in
                    our games or to improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners.</p>
                <p><strong>5.3 Opting-out of interest-based advertising</strong></p>
                <p>You can choose to prevent your device&#8217;s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising by updating
                    the settings on your device. For more information, see How to adjust your preferences for interest based
                    advertising below.</p>
                <p>Please note that if you opt out of interest based advertising, you may still see advertising in our games but
                    those ads will not be targeted using information that we hold about you. However, they may still be delivered
                    based on contextual criteria such as the game that ad is to be displayed in, or the region in which your device
                    is located.</p>

                    <li><strong> Ad identifiers and similar technologies</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>To provide our games and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers and similar technologies. This section
                    describes our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.</p>
                <p>Ad identifiers and similar technologies are used by us to provide our Services to you and in order to collect
                    data from your device. These technologies allow us and our third party advertising partners to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>recognize you and your device;</li>
                    <li>provide interest-based advertising to you;</li>
                    <li>allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow
                        such interaction);allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and</li>
                    <li>enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our
                        Services in the correct language.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>6.1 How do ad identifiers and similar technologies work?</strong></p>
                <p>Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or
                    Apple&#8217;s ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar
                    technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and
                    advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.</p>
                <p><strong>6.2 How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising</strong></p>
                <p>You can choose to prevent your device&#8217;s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can
                    reset your device&#8217;s ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to
                    device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under &#8220;privacy&#8221; or &#8220;ads&#8221; in
                    your device&#8217;s settings.</p>
                <p>If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the collection of your information by some or
                    all of our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting <a
                        href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> (for US users), <a

                    http://youradchoices.ca/choices (for Canadian users). You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an
                    advertisement (where available).</p>
                <p>If you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot
                    enjoy the full use of our Services.</p>
                <p>Notice: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts,
                    it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests.</p>

                    username, avatar, and your high scores may be cached on other players’ devices and we may not be able to remove
                    or update that data from those devices, for example if that device is not connected to a Wi-Fi network.</p>

                    us.</p>
                <p><strong>8.2 Security</strong></p>
                <p>LepreCoin takes appropriate security and technical measures to protect your information from unauthorized
                    access, loss, and misuse. In addition, we request that our suppliers who process personal information on our
                    behalf take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information and maintain an
                    appropriate level of security. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information online and
                    offline, as the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is
                    constantly evolving. As such you should always take care when sharing your information online.</p>
                <p><strong>8.3 Legal Bases</strong></p>
                <p>In each case where we process your information, we do so lawfully in accordance with one of the legal basis set
                    out under European data protection law. The legal bases which we rely upon are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contractual Necessity. </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This covers data used by us in order to provide you with Services that you have requested &#8211; and that we
                    have agreed &#8211; to provide to you, such as our games, customer services, chat functionality and third party
                    social network connectivity;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligation. </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This covers data used by us to comply with a legal obligation, such as the prevention of crime or fraud or to
                    maintain records relating to tax;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests. </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This covers data used by us for purposes that are not harmful to your privacy and can be reasonably expected
                    within the context of your use of our Services, such as Marketing, Advertising, analytics and research and
                    optimization of our games and other Services; and</p>
                <p>Where we ask for your consent to use your data for a particular purpose, we will make this clear at the point of
                    collection and we will also make clear how you can withdraw your consent.</p>
                <p>In this Privacy Policy we have explained how you can opt out of certain types of processing that we undertake and
                    where any processing is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. Nonetheless, if you
                    play our games we will still collect some personal data about you and process it as otherwise described in this
                    Privacy Policy. If you do not wish us to collect any personal data about you at all, you should cease playing
                    our games and stop using our Services.</p>
                <p><strong>8.4 Data Retention</strong></p>
                <p>We will keep your information for as long as your account is active or we consider necessary for the purposes
                    described in our Privacy Policy. We will also retain and use your information for as long as is required in
                    order to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>8.5 Location of storage</strong></p>
                <p>We store your information on servers that we control which are primarily based in the EEA. We may also use
                    servers and engage providers that are located outside the EEA in order to process and store your information and
                    to provide services to us.</p>
                <p><strong>8.6 International Transfer</strong></p>
                <p>We may transfer your information to affiliated entities or third parties to jurisdictions outside the EEA. Please
                    note that these countries outside of the EEA may not have the same data protection laws as your own
                    jurisdiction. We take steps to ensure that there are adequate safeguards and mechanisms in place (including the
                    use of EU model clauses) to allow the transfer of your information across borders outside of the EEA.</p>
                <p><strong>8.7 Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page.
